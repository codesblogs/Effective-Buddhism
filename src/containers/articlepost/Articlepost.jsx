        <h1 className='gradient__text'>Reiterating the Philosphy of Buddhism:</h1><p></p>
        <p>Many buddhists today practice the seeking of enlightenment rather than practicing the way of Buddha himself. Buddha was an enlightened being who spread his philosophy far and wide, preaching and changing and influencing the world and his actions live on to this day.</p><p>
<p></p></p>
<p>Buddhists in most countries are seen as people who simply meditate. The idea is to relinquish attachment to earthly desires in order to DO MORE. Not to meditate all day to do nothing. In an effort of learning all teachings, we will re-evaluate the core values, and give a new perspective based on the teachings. The core re-evaluation leads us to the idea that Nirvana is something to achieve in this realm. And that leaving this realm is a negative desire in it of itself.</p><p></p>

Let’s break them down.<br />
1. To save all people: this is by far the biggest vow that is failed to be recognized by modern Buddhist society. Outreach is a non-factor. So many people who need this valuable information are left in the dark, with no outreach from Buddhists. Actual progress using technology (tools to increase impact) are completely disregarded.<br></br>
2. Many people have regarded this initial vow as meaning to renounce. But here’s what the true text says “**Desires** for tangible things (such as wealth, property, or other material goods) or for pleasures of the body (such as sexual activity, gluttony, or other hedonistic pursuits). Buddhism teaches us to try to let go of our **worldly desires**, freeing our minds and bodies for a state of enlightenment.”As it says, freeing our minds and bodies for a state of enlightenment.<br />
3. Learning all teachings requires knowing all things, we do not even know how consciousness works yet. To learn all teachings, we need to learn by the act of doing. There is no better thing to learn at this time, than how to spread change like Buddha did.<br />
4. “In **Buddhism**, **enlightenment** (called bodhi in Indian **Buddhism**, or satori in Zen **Buddhism**) is when a **Buddhist** finds the truth about life and stops being reborn because they have reached Nirvana.” In order to stop the cycle of rebirth, we must stop the death to life cycle. With infinite time our particles are always brought back to a conscious form. Until we find a conscious form to reach Nirvana in, we will repeat the cycle. “**Rebirth** in Buddhism refers to its teaching that the actions of a person lead to a new existence after death, in an endless cycle called *saṃsāra*.[1][2] This cycle is considered to be *dukkha*, unsatisfactory and painful. The cycle stops only if liberation is achieved by insight and the extinguishing of craving.</p>
